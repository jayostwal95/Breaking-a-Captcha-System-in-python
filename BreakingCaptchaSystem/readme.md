This project shows how advancement of data science deprecating security technologies. 
Specifically, we will using deep learning to break a CAPTCHAsystem called Really 
Simple CAPTCHA, which is a WordPress.org plugin.

Instructions to run the code :Language/technologies used : Python3

Instruction to run the code :

1. Download and install Jupyternotebook.

2.After installing jupyternotebook,you will see the list of all the files loaded in your computer.

3. Locate the folder where the code has been downloaded.

4. Load the file into jupyternotebook making sure its in html or ipynb format.

5.After loading the code into the jupyter notebook,under kernel tab above, there will be an option 'restart and run all'.

6.Click that option and the code will be running with outputs on each cell.

7.Close the jupyternotebook.


Software Used: jupyternotebook.


In the end, you will see the captchas predicting correctly after being trained and using tenserflow library.
